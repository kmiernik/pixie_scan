TODO
====
A list of features to be worked on, implemented, updated, etc. They are
currently in no particular order.

* DOCUMENTATION CHECK and UPDATE
* Revamp the TraceFilterer
* Concatenate all of the logic processors, they do the same things, just with
    various names
* Incorporate changes necessary for Pixie-500 data (MAJOR)
* Update statistics analysis
* Add support for subsubtypes throughout? (Especially to make subtype summaries
    work)
* 48-bit times in RawEvent
* ROOT histogramming
* Smarter (magic) dependency checking
* Find a cogent way to set the analyzer level using "trace" parameter
    from map2.txt
* Add some conglomerated location/type/subtype structure
* Roll-over times for scalar/deadtime spectra
* Check for calibrated energies greater than zero which are always true due to
    float-izing digital values.
* Add a simple method to zero certain rows or columns of 2D histograms
* Hijack KM's readhis library to create his files natively in C
* For Redhat systems, libstdc++.so.5 is necessary to compile with ROOT support.
    Compilation needs to be streamlined in this case.
